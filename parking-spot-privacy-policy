    <p><em>Last updated: August 1, 2023</em></p>
    <p>
        This privacy policy ("Policy") explains how ["Parking Spot"] (referred to as "Application" or "We") collects,

        The Application only uses GPS or other location data to accurately record vehicle parking spots. We do not collect,
        store, or request personal account information from our users.
    </p>

    <h2>2. Google AdMob Ads</h2>
    <p>
        The Parking Spot Application may use Google AdMob ads to support and offer it for free. Google AdMob may collect
        information such as your device's advertising identifier, location data, or other data for ad targeting purposes to
        deliver more relevant and engaging ads. This information may be used to customize the content of the ads based on
        your interests.
    </p>

    <h3>Ads Suitable for Children</h3>
    <p>
        The ads displayed in the Parking Spot Application will not be targeted for children. Ad contents obtained from
        ad providers are selected and delivered in a manner that protects children's privacy and safety, aiming to provide a
        safe experience for child users.
    </p>

    <h3>Ad Categories</h3>
    <p>
        To ensure user safety and privacy, specific ad categories containing inappropriate content for children will not be
        shown or presented within the Application.
    </p>

    <h2>3. Security</h2>
    <p>
        The Application takes appropriate technical and administrative measures to protect user information. However, please
        note that no internet-based service can guarantee absolute security. Users are also advised to use a strong and unique
        password to protect their personal information.
    </p>

    <h2>4. Children's Privacy</h2>
    <p>
        The Application does not intentionally collect personal information from children under 13 years of age. If you are
        a parent or guardian and believe that your child under 13 has provided us with personal information, please contact us,
        and we will promptly delete such information.
    </p>

    <h2>5. Other Links</h2>
    <p>
        Our Application may contain links to other websites or applications. However, we are not responsible for the
        information sharing practices or contents of these linked sites. We recommend being cautious and reading the privacy
        policies of visited websites.
    </p>

    <h2>6. Changes to the Privacy Policy</h2>
